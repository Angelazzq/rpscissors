# rpscissors

This simple python program will play rock-paper-scissors with you.

To run the program, type `python rpscissors.py` in a terminal.

## Suggested Improvements

1. If the user types an invalid input, for example "scissers", the program
   shouldn't crash
2. Modify the program to do best-of-3 or best-of-5 games.
3. Implement a tie-breaker.
4. Modify the program to play rock/paper/scissors/lizard/spock.
5. Alter the way the computer player plays. Rather than completely random, try
